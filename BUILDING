Read me file for building and testing Amino with C/C++

Prerequisites
-------------
Besides the obvious C/C++ compiler, you'll need:

a) GNUmake
b) perl
c) linux tools e.g. Cygwin or equivalent (e.g. 'rm', 'vm' etc)
d) cppunit (http://cppunit.sourceforge.net/cppunit-wiki)

Setup
-----
First, you need to set some environment variables identifying the location of the Amino repository

AMINO_ROOT
   points to the directory containing the source tree. e.g. d:/amino/cpp
 
AMINOBLD_DIR
   points to the directory containing the build tools i.e. $AMINO_ROOT/bin
   
You must run the perl script $AMINOBLD_DIR/makeConfig.pl, and select the platform and compiler

CPPUNIT_ROOT
    For any tests than use cppunit, you must set CPPUNIT_ROOT to point to the directory containing the lib and include directories for cppunit.
    
Building
--------
make 
to build all the components.

Test
---
make check 
to run tests.
